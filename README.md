Here’s a clean and professional `README.md` version of the brief you can copy-paste:

# 🎬 Video Captions & Transcript Sync

## 📁 Project Structure

Inside the shared folder, you'll find two subfolders:

```
📁 video_1/
  ├── clip.mp4
  └── captions.srt

📁 video_2/
  ├── clip.mp4
  └── captions.srt
```

Your task is to build a small web app that:

* Displays a **video with captions overlayed** (no need to support fullscreen)
* Shows the **full transcript**, synced to the video’s timeline
* Both captions and transcript should be based on the `.srt` file

A sample reference video `preview.mp4` is included to demonstrate the minimum expected functionality.

---

## ✅ Requirements

* Display the video's **captions as an overlay**
* Display a synced **transcript below or beside the video**
* You may use any **JavaScript/TypeScript framework** you're comfortable with
* **Third-party libraries** are allowed

---

## 🌟 Bonus Points

You’ll earn extra credit if:

* 🚫 You **don't use a third-party video player library** (use native `<video>` instead)
* 🕒 Clicking a timestamp in the **transcript seeks the video** to that time
* 🎨 Captions can be **custom-styled** (font size, background color, text color)
* 🔄 The solution can **handle any video + `.srt`** file structure
* 💡 You add **any other cool UX ideas or features**

---

## 🚀 Submission

Once completed:

1. Push your code to a **public GitHub repo** (or equivalent)
2. Share the link with us

> 💡 Tip: Focus on getting **one video to work** first before expanding.

---

## ⏱ Estimated Time

This task is expected to take **around 2 hours** for the minimum functionality.
If it takes you longer — that’s totally fine!

**Good luck, you got this! 💪**
